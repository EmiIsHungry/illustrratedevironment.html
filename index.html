    <p> I picked that environment because it shows background,middle ground and foreground but at the same time, I had good memories with it and I liked how I took that picture. I reinterpreted it visually as not just art but something I remade that makes the memory fresh and nostalgic. It also turn into a new way to learn to make art. </p>
